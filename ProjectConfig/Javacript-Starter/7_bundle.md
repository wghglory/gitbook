# Why bundling

* CommonJS doesn't work in web browsers
* Package project into file(s)
* Improve Node performance

## Module Format

* IIFE
* Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)
* CommonJS (CJS)
* Universal Module Definition (UMD)
* ES6 Modules

## Why Use ES6 Modules

* Standardized
* Statically analyzable
  * Improved autocomplete
  * Intelligent refactoring
  * Fails fast
  * Tree shaking
* Easy to read
  * Named imports
  * Default exports

## Bundler

* require.js (old)
* Browserify
* Webpack
* Rollup
* JSPM

### Browserify

* The first bundler to reach mass adoption
* Bundle npm packages for the web
* Large plugin ecosystem

### Webpack

* loaders, plugins
* Bundles more than just JS
* Import CSS, images, etc like JS
* Bundle splitting
* Built in hot-reloading web server
* **Webpack 2 offers tree shaking**

### Rollup

* **Tree shaking**
* **Faster** loading production code
* Quite new
* Great for library authors
* No hot reloading and code splitting yet

### JSPM

* Uses SystemJS, a universal module loader
* Can load modules at runtime
* Has its own package manager
* Can install from npm, git
* Uses Rollup

## Sourcemaps

* To debug. Map code back to original source
* Part of our build
* downloaded only if you open developer tools

write `debugger` in code
