Previous project I used gulp, gulp-eslint. There is a strange bug when I stop watching files once I have a certain number of files. I have to figure out was the bug in gulp? Eslint? gulp-eslint? my gulp config? I have to wait the author to update their plugins.

### Usage

Run concurrently:

```json
"start": "npm-run-all --parallel security-check start:server",
"start2": "npm run security-check & npm run start:server",
```
