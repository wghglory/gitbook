# Array vs Linked list

| Memory requirement           | Fixed size (some may unused); May not be available as a large block; Good for small type, int. | No unused memory; but extra memory for pointer variables; Usually available for multiple small blocks; Good for storing complex type (16 bytes), Node  type (4 byte), totally 20 for one whole (complex)(pointerNode)  -> |

Dynamic list: first allocating a fixed size array in memory. When adding extra elements which above the size, it creates a double size array in new memory address and copies original array to new array, so this is costing.
