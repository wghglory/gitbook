# Amazon leadership principles

#### Customer Obsession

> real-time chat UPMC mapQuest

Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

#### Ownership

> Ub tahoe: instead of a beautiful dropdownList, accordion, implement a reusable plugin, although the layout stays ugly for a while, long-term, easy to maintain, more efficient to use in future.
>
> in SNH, SMS message, angular issue, other teams, they ask for help and I help

Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job".

#### Invent and Simplify

> Unity xml T4 log4net + redis/queue

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

#### Are Right, A Lot

> performance UnitOfWork, Cache reusable dropdown plugin

Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

#### Learn and Be Curious

> how memcache achieve distribute cache? how to use nosql to improve db performance instead of too many joins?

Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

#### Hire and Develop the Best

> no hire experience, but in Tahoe, I introduced ES2015, naming convention, coding style help new employees (Vishal) with angular

Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

#### Insist on the Highest Standards

> UPMC mapQuest, based on customer feedback performance Cache, best user experience

Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

#### Think Big

> instead of single beautiful dropdownList, create reusable, maintainable plugin create a jquery-like helper library, helperClass

Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

#### Bias for Action

> UPMC chart.js, open-source to create charts instead of microsoft server-generated images

Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

#### Frugality

> find open source chart plugin -- chart.js

Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.

#### Earn Trust

> admit mistake when SPA layout changes, an anchor raises error when peers ask, offer help as much as I can

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

#### Dive Deep

> real-time chat, discuss with peers about database design log4net + redis

Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

#### Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

> Jay decides ui and func

Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

#### Deliver Results

> UPMC mapQuest result satisfied customer log4net + redis, has setbacks/obstacles, but carry on

Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.
